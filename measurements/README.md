# Weekly Measurements Extraction  

Helper scripts for retrieving weekly atmospheric measurements (2018–2025) from Copernicus Sentinel-5P datasets:  

- **Carbon Monoxide** (`carbon_monoxide.py`) – `COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_CO`  
- **Ozone** (`ozone.py`) – `COPERNICUS/S5P/NRTI/L3_O3`  

Extracted data is saved as CSV files in the `datasets/` directory.
